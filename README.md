Bone Fracture Detection System
Overview
This project focuses on the development and implementation of an automated system for detecting bone fractures using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. The system is designed to assist radiologists by providing a reliable, efficient, and accurate method for identifying fractures in medical images, such as X-rays.

Motivation
Traditional methods of fracture detection are reliant on the expertise of radiologists, which can lead to time-consuming analysis and potential human error. The aim of this project is to mitigate these issues by offering an automated solution that can support clinical decision-making and enhance diagnostic accuracy.

Key Components
Image Processing:
Techniques Used: Filtering, edge detection, and segmentation are employed to preprocess medical images. These steps enhance critical features that are essential for fracture detection.

Feature Extraction:
The system identifies and extracts relevant features from the preprocessed images. These features, such as shapes, textures, and patterns specific to bone structures, are crucial for accurately detecting fractures.

Machine Learning:
The extracted features are input into a machine learning model trained to distinguish between fractured and non-fractured bones. Algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), or decision trees may be utilized for this purpose.

Implementation
The project utilizes a combination of image processing libraries and machine learning frameworks to build and train the model.
Performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are used to evaluate the system's effectiveness, with testing carried out on a dataset of annotated medical images.

Results
The system achieves a high accuracy rate in detecting bone fractures, demonstrating its potential usefulness in clinical settings.
Comparative analysis of different machine learning models is included, highlighting the most effective approaches.
Conclusion
The Bone Fracture Detection System shows promise as a tool to enhance radiological workflows, offering faster and more accurate fracture diagnosis. Future improvements may focus on increasing the model's robustness, expanding the training dataset, and integrating the system into real-world medical environments.
